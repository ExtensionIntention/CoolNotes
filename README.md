## Initial Product Backlog

| Title | User Story | Additional Details | Acceptance Criteria | Story Points |
| ----- | ---------- | ------------------ | ------------------- | ------------ |
| Web-App - no account | As a student, I want to take notes without needing to sign in, so that I can record my thoughts without unnecessary action. | No mandatory account | There is an web application that can be run on a browser, On application startup there is an empty note item on the board. Ability to export| 8 |
| Spell-Check | As a non-native English speaking student, I need a spell check, so that I can write notes that are free of such mistakes. | Spelling issues | When web-app suggests to correct misspelled words | 3 |
| Sticky Notes | As a non-tech savvy student, I want to use a simple note-taking platform, so that I don’t get confused. | Sticky notes wanted | When toolbar has stickers that can be successfully deployed on the note sheet | 5 |
| Grammar-correction | As a non-English speaking user, I want a software to correct common grammar/punctuation mistakes, so that I can write notes that are free of grammatical mistakes. | Grammar assist feature needed  | When software successfuly makes correction suggestions on common grammar mistakes  | 4 |
| Bulletpoints (lists) | As a conference attendee, I want to be able to take notes with different note-taking essentials, so that I can successfully capture the main points of the event. | Needs to efficiently capture the main points of the event | Toolbar with good variety of bullet points, numbering and other listing techniques (deploy and delete) | 5 |

In free draw mode, user can draw on notes and imported documents. | 8 |
| "Help" section | As a senior user, I want to be able to find “help” section, so that I understand how to use each feature/tool. | “Help” needed | Section on the site that explains how to use items on the toolbar and how to navigate an application as a whole | 13 |
| Contact Section | As a site user, I want to be able to easily delete/undo work, so that I know I won’t spend a lot of time undoing mistakes. | Needs to contact support team | FAQ section | 10 |

### Backlog Ordering
Our backlog is ordered such that a working demo may be produced as quickly as possible. All value generated for the customer stems from the base capabilities of our platform. As such, all dependent features build on this.

### Whole Team Relative Size Estimation
In order to help accurately gauge the effort required to perform backlog items, our team participated in whole team relative size estimating. This technique allows us to plan and adapt by comparing the complexity of our story items by taking advantage of our collective wisdom. Due to the developers being the closest to the problem, they are the ones most suited to do this estimation. As such, only the development team participated in the activity.

## Sprint 1

### Forecasting
11 Story Points: After discussing task complexities team member capabilities during Spring Planning, our estimated forecast velocity was 11 (storypoints per sprint). As such, we pulled the frist two items from the Product Backog to the Sprint Backlog. We believe it likely that we would be able to deliver the first two most important story items as forecasted. This should be a reasonable timeframe for the team members who are not familiar with our software tool choice to ramp up while still creating a tactile product for our stakeholders. We currently believe that the size of each story in the Product Backlog is appropriately sized and does not need to be split into smaller stories.

## Splitting first user story
we realized that our first user story was 8 storypoints and it was not half of our velocity so we splitted it in 2 and is documented at [Trello](https://trello.com/b/DU1kNLqe/cool-notes) as well as tasks for each backlog item.
